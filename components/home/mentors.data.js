From the very first consultation, Dr. Parmeshwar took the time to explain every detail with such calm and clarity that we felt reassured. The hospital maintained a clean and child-friendly environment, which helped reduce our son’s fear. On the day of surgery, the nursing team was gentle and supportive, keeping both our child and us comfortable.The procedure was completed on time and without complications. Post-operative care was closely monitored, and we were guided through every step of recovery. The follow-up visits were handled with patience and kindness. What truly stood out was the way the staff treated our child with genuine warmth and personal attention. We are deeply grateful for the care, professionalism, and empathy shown throughout the entire experience.',
